# Translator
Translates basic Japanese to English and English to Japanese. Also Provides grammar checking for the Japanese sentences. The big limitation is that each word has to be manually entered along with data for that word (such as its type, its length etc).

VERY IMPORTANT: When more words are entered into the dicitonary you must enter them in a specific way that is as follows (without the commas)

romanji, hiragana, english, type (after type if its not a verb stop. Otherwise continue), type of verb (ru, u, unique), if unique put the unqiue translation, type of verb

Examples: 

taberu たべる eat verb ru None action

suru する do verb unique shi action

ginkou ぎんこう bank place

okaasan おかあさん mother noun

tonkatsu とんかつ pork;cutlet noun

As seen above the words that translate into two words should be seperated by a semicolon.
